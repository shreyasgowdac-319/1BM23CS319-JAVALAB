1BM23CS319 - JAVALAB OBSERVATION 
1) Develop a Java program that prints all real solutions to thequadratic equation ax2+bx+c = 0. Read in a, b, c and use
the quadratic formula. If the discriminate b2-4ac isnegative, display a message stating that there are no realsolutions.

2)Develop a Java program to create a class Student withmembers usn, name, an array credits and an array marks.
Include methods to accept and display details and amethod to calculate SGPA of a student.

3)Create a class Book which contains four members: name,author, price, num_pages. Include a constructor to set the
values for the members. Include methods to set and getthe details of the objects. Include a toString( ) method that
could display the complete details of the book. Develop aJava program to create n book objects.



4)Develop a Java program to create an abstract class namedShape that contains two integers and an empty method
named printArea( ). Provide three classes namedRectangle, Triangle and Circle such that each one of the
classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classescontain only the method printArea( ) that prints the area
of the given shape.

5)Develop a Java program to create a class Bank thatmaintains two kinds of account for its customers, one
called savings account and the other current account. Thesavings account provides compound interest and
withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facility. Thecurrent account provides cheque book facility but no
interest. Current account holders should also maintain aminimum balance and if the balance falls below this level,
a service charge is imposed.
Create a class Account that stores customer name,account number and type of account. From this derive the
classes Cur-acct and Sav-acct to make them more specificto their requirements. Include the necessary methods in
order to achieve the following tasks:
a) Accept deposit from customer and update
the balance.
b) Display the balance.
c) Compute and deposit interest
d) Permit withdrawal and update the balance
Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty if
necessary and update the balance.



6)Create a package CIE which has two classes- Student andInternals. The class Personal has members like usn, name,
sem. The class internals has an array that stores theinternal marks scored in five courses of the current
semester of the student. Create another package SEEwhich has the class External which is a derived class of
Student. This class has an array that stores the SEE marksscored in five courses of the current semester of the
student. Import the two packages in a file that declaresthe final marks of n students in all five courses.


7)Write a program that demonstrates handling ofexceptions in inheritance tree. Create a base class called
“Father” and derived class called “Son” which extends thebase class. In Father class, implement a constructor which
takes the age and throws the exception WrongAge( ) whenthe input age<0. In Son class, implement a constructor
that uses both father and son’s age and throws anexception if son’s age is >=father’s age.


8)Write a program which creates two threads, one threaddisplaying “BMS College of Engineering” once every ten
seconds and another displaying “CSE” once every twoseconds.
